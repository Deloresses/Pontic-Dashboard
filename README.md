## Development Notes

- SCSS tokens are separated into `_primitives.scss` and `_semantics.scss`.
- Components are modular and import their own SCSS modules.
- Layout and page structure use CSS Grid based on a 12-column responsive system.
- Global styles are handled in `globals.scss` and `globals.module.scss`.
